  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>How do user ratings reflect customer behavior and influence product performance on Amazon?
  <br>To answer this, I analyzed data on product ratings across various categories. By exploring patterns in user engagement and behavior, I connected these insights to design decisions that can improve Amazon's product pages and customer experience.</br>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>Data was sourced from a dataset repository collected at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) laboratory by Julian McAuley.</p>

    <h2>Data Quality</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Missing units removed</li>
     <li>Columns containing empty observations dropped</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="box">
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Used plotly to create interaction graphs and used tooltips for better user engagement</li>
     <li>Used Amazon inspiried colors for visual representation.</li>
     <li>Key metrics used: average ratings(mean value of ratings withing each category), number of ratings(sum of all ratings in each category), main categories.</li>
     <li>Use of categorical bins created for analysis (e.g Low, Medium, High ratings) for easier interpretation
     </li>
     <li>Removed categories that have very few ratings (less than 10) to focus only on the categories with enough feedback to provide useful insights.

   <h2>Boxplot and scatter plot showing the different categories by Average Rating and Rating Number</h2>

     <p>FIG 1: This shows the average ratings across various Amazon product categories. This shows trend in customer satisfaction. Categories like 'Gift Cards' and 'Amazon Fashion' show high ratings, indicating they meet user expectations effectively. While categories such as 'Appstore for Android' and 'Software' show broader ratings, suggesting mixed customer experiences within these categories. This could be as a result of differences in product quality or customer expectations.
     These insights can help in improving product layout or descriptions. Categories with lower or more broader ratings may benefit from enhanced product quality controls or clearer information presentation to increase user satisfaction.</p>
    </div>

     <div><iframe src="fig2.html"></iframe></div>
     <p>FIG 2: This shows the number of ratings across various categories. It reveals customer engagement levels. The 'Appstore for Android' category has a significantly higher number of ratings, suggesting its widespread use and high engagement compared to other categories. While categories like 'Books' and 'Home Audio & Theater' show much fewer ratings, indicating lower customer interaction.
     This will help prioritize categories with high user interaction for design enhancements and improve user experiences. While categories with less engagements could use strategies such as promotions or improving the process by which the product is discovered.</p>
